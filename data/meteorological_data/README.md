    - Descripton: The MET Nordic dataset consists of post-processed products that (a) describe the current and past weather (analyses), and (b) gives our best estimate of the weather in the future (forecasts). The products integrate output from MetCoOp Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS) as well as measurements from various observational sources, including crowdsourced weather stations. These products are deterministic, that is they contain only a single realization of the weather. The forecast product forms the basis for the forecasts on Yr (https://www.yr.no)

## **Field Names**
1. **seNorge_2018**
    - `rr`: Daily total of precipitation (precipitation day definition: yesterday at 06 UTC / today at 06 UTC) - mm/day
    - `tg`: Mean temperature (yesterday at 06 UTC / today at 06 UTC) - Celsius degrees
    - `tn`: Minimum temperature consistent with TG/TX (yesterday at 18 UTC / today at 18 UTC) - Celsius degrees
    - `tx`: Maximum temperature consistent with TG/TN (yesterday at 18 UTC / today at 18 UTC) - Celsius degrees
2. **MET Nordic dataset**
    - `altitude`: distance above sea level - m
    - `land_area_fraction`: fraction of the area that is land
    - `air_temperature_2m`: Instantaneous temperature at 2 m. Downscaling from 2.5 km to 1 km using elevation gradient approach. Bias-correction using optimal interpolation observations from Netatmo, WMO-stations from MET and FMI, and other non-WMO stations in Norway. Forecast correction using a weighted average of recent temperature biases. - K 
    - `air_pressure_at_sea_level`: 	Instantaneous air pressure reduced to sea level. Bilinear interpolation from 2.5 km NWP. - Pa
    - `cloud_area_fraction`: Fraction of sky covered by cloud. Bias corrected using webcameras from Luftambulansen. Correction to forecast 3 hours into the future. Bilinear interpolation from 2.5 km NWP. - 1
    - `relative_humidity_2m`: Instantaneous relative humidity at 2 m. Bilinear interpolation from 2.5 km NWP. - 1
    - `wind_speed_10m`: 10 minute average speed of wind at 10m. Downscaling using an elevation gradient method. - m/s
    - `wind_direction_10m`: 10 minute average direction of wind at 10m. Direction is where wind is from, and 0 indicates wind from North. Downscaling using an elevation gradient method. Nearest neighbour interpolation from 2.5 km NWP. - degree
